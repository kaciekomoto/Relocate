# Relocate

#### By Kacie Komoto

## About Relocate
Relocate is designed to help those moving to a new city read comments on different neighborhood in the area so they can decide where they may want to live. It's like Yelp but for neighborhoods to live in.

## User Stories
- As the user, I want to see a list of all the different neighborhoods
- As the user, I want to see a map of the area
- As the user, I want to see a brief description of the neighborhood
- As the user, I want to see comments and reviews on the neighborhoods
- As the user, I want to be able to search for a specific location


## Major Hurdles
#### 1. Working with two interconnected models when creating CRUDability

#### 2. HURDLE #2


## Ideas for Future Modifications
1. User Authentication
2. Allow users to provide more information when commenting. 
    For example:
    - Upload pictures
    - State if they lived in location they're commenting on and how long they lived there for
    - Timestamp of when that was commented
3. Add ability to like/bookmark locations
4. Add more information about the location
    For example:
    - Walkscore
    - Safety Rating
    - School District
5. Improve UX/UI Elements and Usability Testing
